# Genetic algorithms
## Project for Architecture of Computer Systems
__Task:__ create parallel library of genetic algorithms for function optimization  

Our library has three methods of genetic algorithms for function optimization:
* genetic algorithm for double using bitwise crossover with two different crossover functions
* genetic algorithm for integer using bitwise crossover with two different crossover functions
* genetic algorithm for double with three different crossover functions
